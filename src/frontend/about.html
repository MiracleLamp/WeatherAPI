                <h1>Mezoscale convective system explanation</h1>
                <p>The MCS (mesoscale convective system) is a multi-cell on steroids, it significantly exceeds it in size and can reach up to 200-300 kilometers, if not higher. It is a cluster of single cells and multicells, it also possibly contains supercells (see below), mesoscale convective systems are not so frequent, but with the trend of climate change they appear more often, they almost always have a squall gate (see photo below) in the ISS there can be absolutely all phenomena characteristic of thunderstorms, but strong winds, a large amount of precipitation and a very intense thunderstorm (lightning discharge rate is usually at least 1 lightning per couple of seconds)</p>
